      'Spicy Slice jalapeño peppers result from hybrid plant breeding, \
    and produce numerous uniform, perfect green pods per plant. \
    These will eventually mature to a sweeter red colour, \
    but at the green stage they are pungent and hot — \
    substantially hotter than Jalapeño M, but with \
    the distinct flavour of jalapeño chiles. This \
    product was something of a hit in our field trials, \
    with plants positively laden with peppers. \
    Everyone who tried it agreed on the superior \
    flavour and genuine piquancy that runs throughout \
    the flesh, not just restricted to the pith and seeds.',

      'Plant Orange Sun pepper seeds for striking, bright orange, sweet bell peppers.  \
      Harvest as succulent, blocky green bell peppers, or wait until the fruits mature \
       to high-vis orange. The 10-13cm (4-5") long fruits have thick flesh with three \
        to four lobes, and really excellent flavour. This is another bell pepper that \
         looks sensational in salads, and has a highly developed interior cavity for \
          stuffing. The productive plants seldom exceed 60cm (24") in height, and work \
           well in three to five gallon containers if the soil is fertile, moist, and \
            freely draining.',
